RFM analysis with Phyton

RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and segment customers based on their transaction history. The acronym RFM stands for Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value, which are the three dimensions used to evaluate customers:

Recency (R): How recently a customer has made a purchase. Customers who recently made a purchase are more likely to buy again compared to those who haven't purchased in a while.

Frequency (F): How often a customer makes a purchase. Customers who purchase more frequently are considered more loyal and potentially more valuable.

Monetary Value (M): How much money a customer has spent. Customers who spend more are usually more valuable to the business.

Steps to Conduct RFM Analysis
Data Collection: Gather transactional data, including customer ID, transaction date, and transaction amount.

Calculate RFM Metrics:

Recency: Calculate the number of days since the customer's last purchase.
Frequency: Count the number of transactions each customer has made within a specific period.
Monetary Value: Sum the total expenditure of each customer within the same period.
Score Each Metric:

Assign scores (typically 1 to 5) to each RFM metric for all customers. Higher scores indicate more desirable behavior.
For example, a customer who made a purchase very recently would get a high recency score.
Create RFM Segments:

Combine the scores to create RFM segments. For instance, a customer with scores R=5, F=4, and M=5 might be placed in a "Top Customer" segment.
Typical segments include "Champions", "Loyal Customers", "Potential Loyalists", "New Customers", and "At Risk".
Analyze and Act:

Use the segments to tailor marketing strategies. For example, "Champions" could receive special offers or rewards, while "At Risk" customers might receive re-engagement campaigns.
Benefits of RFM Analysis
Targeted Marketing: Helps in identifying and focusing on the most valuable customers.
Customer Retention: Allows businesses to implement strategies to retain high-value customers.
Personalized Communication: Facilitates personalized marketing campaigns based on customer behavior.
Resource Optimization: Ensures marketing resources are allocated effectively by focusing on high-potential customer segments.
Example
Consider an e-commerce business that wants to segment its customers using RFM analysis. Here's a simplified example of how they might proceed:

Data Collection:

Customer A: Last purchase 10 days ago, 5 purchases in the last year, spent $500.
Customer B: Last purchase 50 days ago, 2 purchases in the last year, spent $100.
Calculate RFM Metrics:

Customer A: Recency = 10 days, Frequency = 5, Monetary = $500.
Customer B: Recency = 50 days, Frequency = 2, Monetary = $100.
Score Each Metric (assuming a 1-5 scoring system where 5 is best):

Customer A: R=5, F=5, M=5.
Customer B: R=2, F=2, M=1.
Create RFM Segments:

Customer A might fall into the "Champions" segment.
Customer B might fall into the "At Risk" segment.
By using RFM analysis, the business can decide to send special offers to Customer A to reward loyalty and engagement, while creating a re-engagement campaign for Customer B to encourage more frequent purchases.
